##Motivation
The current system of noting down students' outings/leave details in registers is inefficient and time-consuming.

So we developed an application that digitalizes the process of monitoring the movement of students. 
The student has to fill out certain details like phone number, Roll no, etc one time on the app and a new profile will be created.

Each security will have special access to scan the QR code on our Student ID cards to record the in-out time.

When the security scans the QR code, they will have three options Leave/outing/walmi, out of which they should choose one.
Then the out time will be automatically recorded. 

Security will have access to a list of students who are currently on an outing or leave, so they can contact them in case of an emergency. 
When the students come back, and the QR code is scanned, in time will be recorded automatically.

In case of an emergency such as a fire or gas leak, security can send out an emergency alert through this app to all the students in real-time thereby enhancing their safety.

##How to use
Download the .apk file and open it on any android phone to run the app.
